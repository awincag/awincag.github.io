              <h3 class="pink">A Whole History of Me</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="section-content">
              <p>Born and raised in lovely <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/bEYJrXj91YU2" target="_blank" title="South Bay, California">South Bay, California.</a></p>
              <p>I went to an all-boys high school, <a href="https://www.bcp.org/" target="_blank" title="South Bay, California">Bellarmine Prep</a>, where I ran cross country and track and field. I received my undergrad degree in Political Science at <a href="http://www.calpoly.edu/" target="_blank" title="Cal Poly, SLO">California Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo</a>. I also started the <a href="http://cpdistanceclub.com/" target="_blank" title="Cal Poly Distance Club">Cal Poly Distance Club</a> with my best friend Mike, which now has 100+ Members!</p>
              <p>I started my career track in San Francisco (haven&#39;t left... yet), working product management and project management at a small 3 person startup, Ten Dollar Wholesale for close to a year. We did great while I was there, increasing revenue by 120% and product selection from 600 to 1200. It was a great start, but not a great fit for me in the end.  </p>
              <p>Next, I found a small development agency at the time (across the hall -- both companies were sharing space) needed a project / product manager who had the ability to do some wireframing. This was <a href="http://westagilelabs.com" target="_blank" title="West Agile Labs">West Agile Labs</a>, which is where I am today.</p>
              <p>Initially doign project management, I was managing anywhere from 6-8 projects/teams at any given time. Most teams consistented of 2-3 developers and one designer. It be came very evident though that clients needed product thought &amp; management. While most people interact with product, most people completely suck at it. Example: everyone knows how to drive a car, some people now how to fix it. Most people wouldn't want to build their own car and drive it to work everyday. Anyways, doing a combination of product management, where I was introduced to wireframing and product design, and project management, it was clear that my skillsets lied in user experience design. For awhile, I was managing (both product and project) and designing anywhere from 4-5 projects at a time.
              <p>I quickly became insanely passionate about the entire creative &amp; design process. Reverse engineering &amp; designing everything I could get my hands on, reading every design team blog, getting all the books everyone says to buy on medium. I slowly transitioned from product manager to full-stack product designer.</p>
              <p>By now, I&#39;ve worked on over 50+ projects &amp; products. My projects have ranged from emerging, early-stage startups getting their prototype out the door to two Fortune 500 companies. I&#39;ve sourced and hired 4 designers and currently manage 3 of them. With legacy projects, I still oversee product development completely, one with a team of 8 developments. I&#39;ve had the opportunity to lead art direction on our company rebrand as well as do all of the front-end development for our new company website. </p>
              <p>I specialize in interaction design, but have the ability to work on storyboarding, branding (mainly typography), visual design, animation design, front-end development and product management. I currently lead our awesome design team of 5. I champion the value and need for design on our all of our products to both the clients and the rest of the West Agile team. I aim to bridge the gap between development and all visual communication. I love what I do. </p>
              <p>Occasionally, I&#39;ll do freelance work on the side. Scroll down to learn more about my philosophy and getting in contact. </p>
              <p>I also make some really good breakfast tacos. Seriously, this shit is decandant and almost hedonistic.

              <div class="line-break"></div>
              <h3 class="pink">Philosophy and Process</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="section-content">
              <p>There are a few areas that drive my passion and approach to design.</p>
              <div class="quote">
                <p>"Simple ain&#39;t Easy"</p>
                <p class="author">Thelonious Monk</p>
              </div>
              <p>Designing simple and elegant solutions are 1) rarely discovered the first 25+ tries 2) not simple at all. I&#39;m of the camp that in order to design a beautiful user experience and a great product, it's going to take a lot grinding and a whole lot of iteration (Joe Stewart of Work &amp; Co, would call it <a href="http://99u.com/articles/50973/the-brute-force-school-of-design-prototyping-over-presentations" target="_blank" title="plumbing">'brute force'</a>).</p>
              <div class="quote">
                <p>"Build around people problems, not company problems"</p>
                <p class="author">Nikel Blaase</p>
              </div>
              <p>Great design all starts with a great problem. If there's not a user problem, then there's probably not much, if any, design needed at all. Without a problem, you have a feature, not a digital product or service. A truly great product doesn't just provide more than just a fantastic flow, amicable animations and eye-candy branding (it definitely needs all of that), but it needs to provide value to the user, a lot of value. When you can find the value a product provides the user, that's when the product becomes more than just a feature or zombie app.</p>
              <p>To solve people problems, that means understanding people and businesses, not just how to code. Being able to optimize a stylesheet is great for improving the 0.5 seconds of a persons life, but if that product doesn't solve their problem, you just wasted a lot more than 0.5 seconds. To this end, with all my projects, I truly push to find that deeper problem that people have and solve it, really, really well. It&#39;s not the "what lawnmower do I use?" It's the "what&#39;s the best way to key my grass short."
              <div class="quote">
                <p>Design is not a manufactured good.</p>
              </div>
              <p>All too often, I hear people at work talk about how great their process is. How their process allows them to build the best products. I would disagree. Having a great process is only a fraction of the journey. Great design means bespoke solutions for each problem.<!-- Putting a process to design unfortunately starts to commoditize design, devaluing it's nature. Great design isn&#39;t &amp; shouldn&#39;t automated nor is it created by a machine (at least not yet). A perfect process is an admirable goal, but in the mean time, each product has it's own journey.</p> -->
              <p>No two products are identical. Every solution is unique and every journey to find that solution is unique. While I have general practices that help solve problems, the only thing that truly stays the same in every project is finding out: What is that core problem?</p>
              <p>From there, the journey can manifest itself in a variety of ways. Dependent on the amount of initial data, I can start with user interviews, core screens, design studio with the team or a varities of other activities that help drive towards that solution. Ultimately, my job as a designer is to help provide value to people through digital products &amp; services.</p>

              <p>Being creative doesn&#39;t mean being limited to pixels. I&#39;m a huge fan of music and photography.</p>
              <p>I played piano and guitar for 8 years respectively. More recently, I produce music with the help of my handy dandy friend, <a href="https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/" target="_blank" title="Fl Studio">FL Studio.</a>You can hear some of that music <a href="https://soundcloud.com/awincag" target="_blank" title="Soundcloud">here</a>.</p>

              <p>I try to do as much photography as I can. I normally shoot with a <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/892349-REG/Canon_8035b002_EOS_6D_Digital_Camera.html" target="_blank" title="Canon 6d">Canon 6d</a> and <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/843008-USA/Canon_5175B002_EF_24_70mm_f_2_8L_II.html" target="_blank" title="Campm 24-70mm">Canon 24-70mm f/2.8</a>, which I feel like allows me to take the best photos of my favorite subject, people. <a href="https://500px.com/alexcagwin" target="_blank" title="500px">Here's</a> some photo's that I've taken in the past. I love doing portrait photography, so if you&#39;d like to shoot together, let&#39;s connect.</p>
              <p>My biggest passion is making some delicious breakfast tacos. Not like some okay tacos you get from a quasi-tqaueria, but breakfast tacos that literally blow your pants off.
